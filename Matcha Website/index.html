                <p>Matcha is a finely ground powder made from specially grown and processed green tea leaves. Unlike regular green tea, where leaves are steeped and discarded, matcha involves consuming the entire leaf in powdered form, which maximizes its nutritional value. Traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies, matcha is celebrated for its brilliant green color, slightly bitter yet umami-rich flavor, and numerous health benefits—including high levels of antioxidants, L-theanine for calm focus, and natural caffeine for gentle energy.</p>

                <p>Known as <strong>Sadō</strong> or <strong>Chadō</strong>, the Japanese tea ceremony is more than just drinking tea. It is a spiritual and cultural ritual that reflects the principles of harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility. Every movement carries symbolic meaning. The setting is designed to create a moment of mindfulness and connection between host and guest.</p>

                <p>It also reflects <strong>omotenashi</strong>, or respectful hospitality, where the host creates a serene, welcoming atmosphere for guests.</p>

        <h3>Who started Matcha in Japan?</h3>
        <div class="two-column">
            <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Matcha history">
            <div>
                <p>The origins of matcha can be traced back to Tang Dynasty China. Zen Buddhist monks brought this method to Japan in the 12th century. Over time, matcha became deeply integrated into Japanese culture. In the 16th century, tea master Sen no Rikyū redefined the ceremony by emphasizing simplicity, humility, and spiritual awareness.</p>
