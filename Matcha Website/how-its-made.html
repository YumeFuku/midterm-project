            <div>
                <p>About 20–30 days before harvest, tea bushes are carefully shaded from sunlight. This slows down photosynthesis and increases the production of chlorophyll and L-theanine—resulting in the vibrant green color and umami taste unique to matcha.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Only the youngest, softest leaves at the top of the plant are hand-picked to ensure premium quality. This delicate work is often done by skilled workers and plays a vital role in the flavor and texture of the final matcha.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The freshly picked leaves are quickly steamed to stop oxidation. This step helps preserve the green color, flavor, and nutrients of the tea leaves. It also locks in the grassy aroma that defines high-quality matcha.</p>

            <div>
                <p>After steaming, the leaves are cooled and dried. The resulting leaf is called <strong>tencha</strong>. Unlike other green teas, tencha is not rolled. This unique step ensures the final matcha powder will be smooth and light.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The dried tencha leaves are ground using traditional stone mills. This slow and careful process ensures the powder is ultra-fine and retains its natural color, aroma, and nutrients. It can take an hour to produce just 30 grams of high-quality matcha!</p>
